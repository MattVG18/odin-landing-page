                <p>When males are fighting, they charge at each other and break branches. If that doesn't scare one of
                    them away, they grapple and bite each other.</p>

                <p>To take advantage of lack of food competition, uakaris mostly eat unripe foods with their specialized
                    canines and particularly strong jaw muscles which allow them to break into the tough outer shell of
                    fruit. Then, they’ll use their specialized incisors to scrape out the tougher flesh</p>

                <p>Locals call them Dutchmen due to their pink faces, pot belly, ambling gait, and the male’s massive
                    nose (an unflattering, but perhaps earned, reference to their former colonial rulers)</p>

                    nocturnal monkey. This beautiful looking creature can only be found in the tropical and subtropical
                    forests of South America</p>
